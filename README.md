# Sentiment Analysis on Video Game Reviews

# Research and Selection of Methods
### Objectives
Our primary objective is to design and implement a robust pipeline that processes raw textual data, extracts meaningful features, and employs state-of-the-art classification algorithms to gauge sentiment accurately. This approach aims to provide actionable insights that can influence game development, marketing strategies, and overall industry decision-making.

The central challenge lies in interpreting the varied and often nuanced language found in game reviews. Reviews may include slang, domain-specific jargon, and subtle emotional cues that complicate sentiment classification. Overcoming these hurdles involves rigorous data cleaning, text normalization, and feature extraction. Our solution will harness both traditional machine learning and modern deep learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in sentiment analysis.
